# My first React App

This project was made with the intent of developing my skills and usage of the React library. It was 
bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

This website utilizes React with TypeScript. The process was slow at first, with many doubts about the use of hooks. Despite this, I chose to continue using them because, for me, they make more sense than the object-oriented approach. This was my first project with React and TypeScript, so it was complex to use everything correctly in the beginning. Despite that, from that time on, things started to make sense.

### Funcionality

This project has a regressive countdown as its first functionality, which determines how much time is left to reach a defined date. For this case, I chose the release of Persona 5 as the theme, both for the love of the game and for the design decisions that would be guided by it. In addition, in collaboration with my friend Levi Rios, I incorporated a news API, with a fixed searchTerm, seeking to enrich the site's experience.

### Conclusion

It was essential to carry out this project to really understand how react is used. In this sense, I can safely say that its use is no longer intimidating as before, and that I will definitely continue to use it in other projects.
